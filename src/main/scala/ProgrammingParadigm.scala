object ProgrammingParadigm {

  /*three programming paradigms
  1.imperative programming
    -> modifying mutable variables
    -> using assignments
    -> and controle structures such if-then-else, loops , break, continue, return
    -> intruction sequence for a von Neumann computer

  Mutable variables       -> memory cells
  Variable dereferences   ->  load instr
  variable asignment      -> store instr
  contrl inst     -> jumps

   problem -> scaling up
     conceptualize data strucres word by word
     -> higher level abstractions were needed  -> collections

     Theory -> data types
     -> operations
     -> ex. -> sum of polynomials
     -> in theory concatenation of strings is associative

  2. Logic programming
   ->


  3. functional programming
   -> restricted sense -> programming without mutable variables , assignments, loops , and the other imperative control structures
      lang -> haskell
   -> wider sense
   -> focus on the functions
   -> functions are values that are produced consumed and composed
   -> functional programming language enables the constrution of elegant programns that focus on functions
   -> functions are first class citizens
      - it means they can be defined anywhere, including inside other functions
      - they can be passed as parameters to functions and returned as results
      - as for other values there exists a set of operators to compose functions

    -> exploiting parallelism and concurrency for multicore and cloud computing
